                             Graph
                            -------
1)Graph is a collction of vertices(nodes) and edges(relationships)
    G=(V,E)

Real world applications of graph
-------------------------------
1.Maprealted-gmap,zomato,swiggy
2.social networks-insta,facebook,threads,snap,twitter.

Difference between Trees and Graphs
------------------------------------

       Trees                                Graphs
      -------                             ---------
1.All trees are graphs                  1.All graphs are not trees

2.Tree have a start node called         2.In graph,any vertex      
  root.                                   can be a start node.

3.Tree have no cycles                   3.Cycles are allowed in graph.

4.Directed                              4.Directed/undirected

5.Connected                             5.Connected/disconnected

6.unique path between any two           6.Many paths exist between any two vertices
vertices.

7.Directed,connected,acyclic.           7.directed/undirected
                                          cyclic/acyclic
                                          connected/disconnected

Degree of a node
----------------
1.Degree of Node= no.of edges attached to it.(Incoming+outgoing)
2.Total degree of cyclic graph=2*E

Edge weight
-----------
1.Every edge have a weight.

Input
-----
1.Given n and m.
2.Whether the graph is a directed or undirected.
3.2D matrix which represents the edges between nodes(Adjacency matrix) (or) List way.
